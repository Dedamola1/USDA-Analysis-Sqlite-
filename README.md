# USDA-Analysis-sqlite-

USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has been tracking the production of various agricultural commodities across different states. 

Datasets include:
`milk_production`, `cheese_production`, `coffee_production`, `honey_production`, `yogurt_production`, and a `state_lookup` table. 

The data spans multiple years and states, with varying levels of production for each commodity.

The aim of this project is to you generate insights from this data to aid in future planning and decision-making. 

Objectives:

1. Assess state-by-state production for each commodity.
2. Identify trends or anomalies.
3. Offer data-backed suggestions for areas that may need more attention.
